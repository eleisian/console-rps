# console-rps

Hello, welcome to my project.
I have created a rock paper scissors game that the player can play with the JS prompt() function. 
The player can review the game inside of the console and keep track of their score. 
This program greets the user and asks for the user's name. 
Then, the game begins. 

You can play it here: 


Thank you for reviewing!
